Starting with this project I have decided to abandon Tailwind or any other CSS framework per the recommendation of TOP.

### Project Goals
- More frequent commits and better commit messaging.
- Pure CSS, no frameworks
- Create a visually appealing and highly functional product
- Use at least one skill from each lesson of the course so far that are applicable.
    - Emmet
    - Normalize
    - Proper CSS units
    - Custom fonts
    - CSS props
    - Advanced selectors
    - Positioning
    - Custom props
    - Form Basics
    - Form validation
- Non applicable
    - SVG
    - Tables
    - Frameworks and preprocessors
    - Javascript should not be needed

### End of Project reflections
I was able to successfully meet all my goals for this project.  The final product I believe matched the spirit of the assignment and in small ways exceeded it.

### What would I do differently?
First, I would 'pre-organize' the CSS.  These Odin projects are growing in scale and it was a lot of work to organize things after the fact.

As well, I would put more thought into id VS class selectors up front.  I found towards the end that I had a bunch of unused IDs and was using multiple ID selectors where classes would have been more appropiate.  This did lead me down a rabbit hole on the topic where I learned a lot.

Possibly I would change my approach to custom props.  For this project I tried to figure all that I need up front.  There were a few I missed and a few I didn't end up needing.  Going forward it seems like a decent rule of thumb might be "the 2nd time you use the same value on a different element, make it a prop".  That will come with experience though, knowing intuitively which values should be props and which should not.
